= Meter polyfill

This is a polyfill for implementing the HTML5 <tt><meter></tt> element in browsers that do not currently support it.

== Usage

Using it is easy — simply include the +meter-polyfill.js+ file in the HEAD of the HTML page. You can then use <tt><meter></tt> elements normally.

The script will look through each <tt><meter></tt> element on the page and construct its own graphical meter using two <tt><div></tt> elements. This is then added as a child of the <tt><meter></tt> element, to serve as a fallback. Browsers that support <tt><meter></tt> elements will still show them natively, while browsers that don't support them will instead show our <tt><div></tt> meters.

A default css file is provided. You may edit this file to style the meters to make them look the way you want.

== Dependencies

This script requires only the jQuery[http://jquery.com/] library.
